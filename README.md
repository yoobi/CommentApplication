# CommentApplication

Simple application to display 2 depths of comment without extra library.

### Comment display
<img src="github/comment_1.jpeg" alt="comment_1" width="25%" height="25%">

### Nested Comment display
<img src="github/comment_2.jpeg" alt="comment_2" width="25%" height="25%">


Disclaimer: There are many string that should be in `strings.xml` and a better way to do some actions.
It's just a small example on how I'd like it to work for me, you should modify if you want a real nested comment
